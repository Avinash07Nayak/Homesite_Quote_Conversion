Homesite is a Property and Casualty Insurance Company headquartered in Boston, MA. Homesite Quote Conversion is a Kaggle competition which challenges us to predict which customers will purchase a given insurance quote (Quote Conversion). Homesite has provided us with its large anonymized database of information on customer and sales activity, including property and coverage information and asking us to design ML models which will help them in predicting which Quote will get converted into Sales.

This is a Binary Classification problem. For a given Insurance Quote, we need to predict whether it can be converted into a sale or not.
